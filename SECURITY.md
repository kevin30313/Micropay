Instead, please send an email to: **security@micropay.com** (replace with actual email)

Include the following information:
- Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

### 3. Response Timeline

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers
1. **Keep dependencies updated**: Regularly update npm packages
2. **Use environment variables**: Never hardcode secrets
3. **Validate input**: Always validate and sanitize user input
4. **Follow OWASP guidelines**: Implement OWASP Top 10 protections
5. **Code reviews**: All code changes require security review

### For Deployment
1. **Use HTTPS**: Always use TLS/SSL in production
2. **Secure configurations**: Follow security hardening guides
3. **Regular updates**: Keep OS and runtime updated
4. **Backup security**: Encrypt backups and test recovery
5. **Access control**: Implement least privilege principle

## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. **Investigation**: We investigate all legitimate reports
2. **Acknowledgment**: We acknowledge helpful security researchers
3. **Coordination**: We coordinate with reporters on disclosure timeline
4. **Public disclosure**: We publicly disclose vulnerabilities after fixes are deployed
